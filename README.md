# Avoid the Veggies
#### Unit 1 - GA - Browser Game Project

This game takes a colourful spin from the classic minesweeper game. The only difference is that instead of sweeping for mines, you are avoiding the ones who put veggies on your pizza. If you run into one, it looks like you will have to be picking veggies off the pizza... but lets be honest, no matter how good you are at picking them off, the pizza still has the taste of veggies on it.
